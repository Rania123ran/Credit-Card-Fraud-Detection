# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection
Detect fraudulent card transactions with Python / scikit-learn using two models:
Logistic Regression (with feature scaling) and Random Forest (no scaling).

Goals

Explore fraud patterns (atypical amounts, new merchants, online purchases).

Train and compare Logistic Regression and Random Forest.

Produce probabilities and pick a practical decision threshold.

Keep the pipeline simple, reproducible, and easy to adapt.
